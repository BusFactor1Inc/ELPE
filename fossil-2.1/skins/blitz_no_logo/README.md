## Blitz Theme (no logo)

Contributed by James Moger (james.moger@gitblit.com)

This theme is inspired by my own project, [Gitblit](http://gitblit.com), and offered to the Fossil project.

This theme embeds & uses an unmodified copy of [Normalize 3.0.2](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) which is distributed under an [MIT license](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

This theme uses half of a heavily-modified version of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) which is distributed under an [MIT license](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/blob/master/LICENSE.md).  None of the responsive elements (media queries) are included at this time.

The font used in the included Fossil logo image is [Trillium Web Light](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Titillium+Web) @ 48px HTML color code #456a7a.

The RSS feed icon is sourced from [Font-Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons) by Dave Gandy and is distributed under the [SIL OFL 1.1 ](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) license.
