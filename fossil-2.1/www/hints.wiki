<title>Fossil Tips And Usage Hints</title>

  1.  Click on nodes of any timeline graph to see diffs between the two
      selected versions.

  2.  Add the "--tk" option to "[/help?cmd=diff | fossil diff]" commands
      to get a pop-up
      window containing a complete side-by-side diff.  (NB:  The pop-up
      window is run as a separate Tcl/Tk process, so you will need to
      have Tcl/Tk installed on your machine for this to work.  Visit
      [http://www.activestate.com/activetcl] to for a quick download of
      Tcl/Tk if you do not already have it on your system.)

  3.  The "[/help/clean | fossil clean -x]" command is a great
      alternative to "make clean". You can use "[/help/clean | fossil clean -f]"
      as a slightly safer alternative if the "ignore-glob" setting is
      not set. WARNING: make sure you did a "fossil add" for all source-files
      you plan to commit, otherwise those files will be deleted without warning.

  4.  Use "[/help?cmd=all | fossil all changes]" to look for any uncommitted
      edits in any of your Fossil projects.  Use
      "[/help?cmd=all | fossil all pull]" on your laptop
      prior to going off network (for example, on a long plane ride)
      to make sure you have all the latest content locally.  Then run
      "[/help/all|fossil all push]" when you get back online to upload
      your changes.

  5.  To see an entire timeline, type "all" into the "Max:" entry box.

  6.  You can manually add a "c=CHECKIN" query parameter to the timeline
      URL to get a snapshot of what was going on about the time of some
      check-in.  The "CHECKIN" can be
      [./checkin_names.wiki | any valid check-in or version name], including
      tags, branch names, and dates.  For example, to see what was going
      on in the Fossil repository on 2008-01-01, visit
      [http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/timeline?c=2008-01-01].

  7.  Further to the previous two hints, there are lots of query parameters
      that you can add to timeline pages.  The available query parameters
      are tersely documented [/help?cmd=/timeline | here].

  8.  You can run "[/help?cmd=test-diff | fossil test-diff --tk $file1 $file2]"
      to get a pop-up  window with side-by-side diffs of two files, even if
      neither of the two files is part of any Fossil repository.  Note that
      this command is "test-diff", not "diff".

  9.  On web pages showing the content of a file (for example
      [http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/artifact/c7dd1de9f]) you can manually
      add a query parameter of the form "ln=FROM,TO" to the URL that
      will cause the range of lines indicated to be highlighted.  This
      is useful in pointing out a few lines of code using a hyperlink
      in an email or text message.  Example:
      [http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/artifact/c7dd1de9f?ln=28,30].
      Adding the "ln" query parameter without any argument simply turns
      on line numbers.   This feature only works right with files with
      a mimetype of text/plain, of course.

  10.  When editing documentation to be checked in as managed files, you can
       preview what the documentation will look like by using the special
       "ckout" branch name in the "doc" URL while running "fossil ui".
       See the [./embeddeddoc.wiki | embedded documentation] for details.
