<title>What People Are Saying</title>

The following are collected quotes from various forums and blogs about
Fossil, Git, and DVCSes in general.  This collection is put together
by the creator of Fossil, so of course there is selection bias...

<h2>On The Usability Of Git:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Git approaches the usability of iptables, which is to say, utterly
unusable unless you have the manpage tattooed on you arm.

<li><nowiki>It's simplest to think of the state of your [git] repository
as a point in a high-dimensional "code-space",  in which branches are
represented as n-dimensional membranes, mapping the spatial loci of
successive commits onto the projected manifold of each cloned
repository.</nowiki>

<li>Git is not a Prius. Git is a Model T.
Its plumbing and wiring sticks out all over the place.
You have to be a mechanic to operate it successfully or you'll be
stuck on the side of the road when it breaks down.
And it <b>will</b> break down.

<li>I've been experimenting a lot with git at work.
Damn, it's complicated.
It has things to trip you up with that sane people just wouldn't ever both with
including the ability to allow you to commit stuff in such a way that you can't find
it again afterwards (!!!)
Demented workflow complexity on acid?

<li>Klingon Code Warriors embrace Git; we enjoy arbitrary conflicts. Git is not for the weak and feeble. TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO CODE.

<li>&#91;I&#93;n nearly 31 years of using a computer i have, in total, lost more data to git
(while following the instructions!!!) than any other single piece of software.

<li>If programmers _really_ wanted to help scientists, they'd build a version control
system that was more usable than Git.

<h2>On The Usability Of Fossil:</h2>

<ol>
<li value=11>
Fossil mesmerizes me with simplicity especially after I struggled to
get a bug-tracking system to work with mercurial.

</blockquote>

<li>Fossil is the best thing to happen
to my development workflow this year, as I am pretty sure that using
Git has resulted in the premature death of too many of my brain cells.
I'm glad to be able to replace Git in every place that I possibly can
with Fossil.

<li>Fossil is awesome!!! I have never seen an app like that before,
such simplicity and flexibility!!!

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<li>This is my favourite VCS. I can carry it on a USB. And it's a complete system, with it's own
server, ticketing system, Wiki pages, and a very, very helpful timeline visualization. And
the entire program in a single file!

<h2>On Git Versus Fossil</h2>

<ol>
<li value=15>
Just want to say thanks for fossil making my life easier....
Also <nowiki>[for]</nowiki> not having a misanthropic command line interface.

<blockquote>
<i>Joshua Paine at [http://www.mail-archive.com/fossil-users@lists.fossil-scm.org/msg02736.html]</i>
</blockquote>

<li>We use it at a large university to manage code that small teams write.
The runs everywhere, ease of installation and portability is something that
seems to be a good fit with the environment we have (highly ditrobuted,
sometimes very restrictive firewalls, OSX/Win/Linux).  We are happy with it
and teaching a Msc/Phd student (read complete novice) fossil has just
been a smoother ride than Git was.

<blockquote>
<i>viablepanic at [http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bxcto/why_not_fossil_scm/]</i>
</blockquote>

<li>In the fossil community - and hence in fossil itself - development history
is pretty much sacrosanct. The very name "fossil" was to chosen to
reflect the unchanging nature of things in that history.

<p>In git (or rather, the git community), the development history is part of
the published aspect of the project, so it provides tools for rearranging
that history so you can present what you "should" have done rather
than what you actually did.

<blockquote>

<li>github is such a pale shadow of what fossil does.
