<title>Fossil SCGI</title>

To run Fossil using SCGI, start the [/help/server|fossil server] command
with the --scgi command-line option.  You will probably also want to
specific an alternative TCP/IP port using --port.  For example:

<blockquote><pre>
fossil server $REPOSITORY --port 9000 --scgi
</pre></blockquote>

Then configure your SCGI-aware web-server to send SCGI requests to port
9000 on the machine where Fossil is running.  A typical configuration for
this in Nginx is:

<blockquote><pre>
location ~ ^/demo_project/ {
    include scgi_params;
    scgi_pass localhost:9000;
    scgi_param SCRIPT_NAME "/demo_project";
    scgi_param HTTPS "on";
}
</pre></blockquote>

Note that Nginx does not normally send either the PATH_INFO or SCRIPT_NAME
variables via SCGI, but Fossil needs one or the other.  So the configuration
above needs to add SCRIPT_NAME.  If you do not do this, Fossil returns an
error.
