This page contains URLs for file-age computations that have given
trouble in the past.  Shif-click on on the links, one-by-one, to verify
that the current implementation works correctly:

  *  [/fileage?name=c9df0dcdaa402] - Verify that the many
     execute permission changes that occurred about 24 hours before
     check-in c9df0dcdaa402 do not appear as file changes.

  *  [/tree?ci=c9df0dcdaa40&mtime=0&type=tree] - Verify that all
     three skin files (css.txt, footer.txt, and header.txt) appear
     in all of the skin/*/ folders.

  *  On both of the above, check for excessive computation time.
